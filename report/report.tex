\abstract{
Cities are inherently dynamic, and interesting patterns of behavior often manifest at several key areas of a city over multiple temporal resolutions. Recent technological innovations have enabled the collection of enormous amounts of data that can help in studying these patterns. However, techniques utilizing these data sets typically focus on understanding the data in the context of the city, thus failing to capture the dynamic aspects of the city. In this work, we utilized computational text mining methods\cite{b2} to analyze user reviews from the Yelp Open Dataset in the top five cities with the most points of interest (POIs) to discover how people use these POIs for social interaction. We geolocated the results and spatially analyzed the locations of POIs with reviews mentioning relationship keywords. Additionally, we explored the concept of "urban pulse" which captures the spatio-temporal activity in a city across multiple temporal resolutions \cite{b1}. We used urban pulse to analyze the activity in the top five cities with the most POIs.
Our analysis shows that different parts of the city host different types of relationships, and in some cases, there is little overlap. Certain POIs also support different types of relationships more than others. We also developed an interactive online tool that allows users to select a relationship type of interest (e.g., "family") and search for POIs whose reviews mention these relationships along with their activity across different temporal resolutions.
The findings of this study can be useful for urban planners to reflect upon what kinds of places help support social ties, which ties may need more places for their outings, and how a city can evaluate whether its social infrastructure supply is meeting the demands of residents and visitors.
