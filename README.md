# Capturing Urban Pulses and its Social Fabrics

Urban areas are complex and dynamic environments, constantly changing and evolving over time. As cities grow and change, they present a range of challenges for city planners, architects, and human behavioral experts to understand and navigate. Recent advancements in technology have enabled the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data, providing new opportunities to gain insights into the dynamics of urban environments.

This project builds on two previous studies, one focused on the concept of ”[urban pulses](https://fmiranda.me/publications/urban-pulse/tvcg-2017-urbanpulse.pdf)” and the other on the use of points
of interest (POIs) to understand the social fabrics of urban areas [POI](http://urban-computing.com/urbcomp2022/file/UrbComp2022_paper_6824.pdf).
